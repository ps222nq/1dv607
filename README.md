#Get the application up and running

##The Easy Way
1. [Download and run rlerdorfs preconfigured vagrant box for testing php apps:](https://github.com/rlerdorf/php7dev)

2. Open up a terminal, make sure the vagrant box is running and cd to the path where the box is.
3. vagrant ssh in to the box
4. vagrant@php7dev:~$ cd /var/www/default/
5. vagrant@php7dev:~$ git clone 

##The Hard Way
To be able to run the application you need an installation of [nginx](https://nginx.org/) and [php7](http://php.net/downloads.php).
